## Very basic shopping app.

Shopping cart is based on user session. Could be used for small e-commerce.


### There are mainly 2 types of users:

1. Unregistered guest/registered user -  users can order products They can add maximum 5 items at once. Choose size of them.
  At shopping cart there is subtotal and total price of the order. 
  They still can update amount and size of the product. 
  **Order item operations are done without page refreshing thanks to AJAX.**
  Cart view is rendered after placing first item to it.
  **After placing an order email with quantity and total cost of products is send to user.**
